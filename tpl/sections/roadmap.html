      <p class="mb-4">Currently this project is a prototype which is not yet being used. The next step will be to present the software to the hospital staff and to find out what they need in their day-to-day work. The first release of the system is then intended to be a very simple system with a handful of features. Then it can grow organically year by year, along with the hospital.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Once the software is in use we want to search for further volunteers to move the project forward. As volunteers only have very limited time available, we also want to collect donations to entrust software development agencies with the development of further features.</p>
