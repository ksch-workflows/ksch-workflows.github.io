# Techniques

## BPMN

The Business-Process and Modeling Notation (BPMN) is one of the most used notations
for modeling business processes. While others like [Domain Story Telling](http://domainstorytelling.org/)
may be easier to use, it has the advantage that the hospital processes can be described
in detail. Those models can then be applied for the creation of development specifications
and guidelines for user acceptance tests.
