The project started out with an attempt to implement the open-source hospital information
system [Bahmni](https://www.bahmni.org/) in the Kirpal Sagar Charitable Hospital.
Though this is an excellent software it seems like it is not a perfect fit for
us at the moment. Thus we are currently
evaluating other options. The detailed analysis can be found in
